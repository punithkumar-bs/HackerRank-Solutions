Answer: Segment Tree

By "updates" they mean inserting/deleting an element in the data structure.
By "queries" they mean searching for a specific element.

Notice that a segment tree (assuming it's balanced) will have height = log n. 
Whether we do an insert, delete, or query, we start from the root and decide 
to go left or right at each node/level in the tree. We have to make (log n) 
of these decisions since that is the height of the segment tree.
