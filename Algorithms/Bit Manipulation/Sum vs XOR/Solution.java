// XOR represents binary addition without the "carry" for each digit. We want to see
// how many values of x that will give us n+x = n^x, which is when XOR is the same as
// ADDITION. This happens when there are no "carries". To make sure there are no
// carries, for each digit in "n" that is a 1, we must have the corresponding digit in
// "x" be a 0. For each digit in "n" that is a 0, we can have the corresponding digit 
// in "x" be either 0 or 1. Now we calculate the number of possibilities for "x" by 
// counting the number of 0s in "n" (up to the most significant 1 in n), and doing 
// 2^(number of 0s) (where ^ is exponentiation in this case) to count all combinations.
