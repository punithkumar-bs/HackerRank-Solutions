I use isProbablePrime() with certainty = 10 to achieve 99.9% accuracy. 
However, even certainty = 1 (which achieves 50% accuracy) is enough to 
pass the HackerRank test cases.

isProbablePrime() is always 100% certain if it tells you if a number 
is "not prime". If it says "prime", it's only 99.9% certain. It may be 
the case that it just hasn't found a prime number number that divides 
the BigInteger yet.
